                            What is intimacy?</li>
                        <p class="text-gray-900">An intimate relationship can be deeply personal, allowing each person to be vulnerable with the other. While a physical connection can often be associated with this, intimacy doesn’t need to be physical to exist.
                            There are three types of intimacy: emotional intimacy, physical intimacy and sexual intimacy.
                            In general, intimacy involves a particular level of closeness.

                            What is sex?</li>
                        <p class="text-gray-900">Discussing sex can be complicated. Strictly speaking, sex is physical. No matter the form, sex involves the arousal of physical desire and physical response to a stimulus.
                            Sex by itself doesn’t necessarily require intimacy. For some, intimacy is implied when discussing sex, especially in a relationship. For others, sex can occur in an impersonal and disconnected manner.

                        <p class="text-gray-900">Sexual harassment is unwelcome sexual behaviour that’s offensive, humiliating or intimidating. It can be written, verbal or physical, and can happen in person or online.
                            Anybody can experience sexual harassment, regardless of their gender. When it happens at work, school or university, sexual harassment may amount to a form of discrimination.

                            What is the difference between sexual harassment and sexual assault?</li>
                        <p class="text-gray-900">Sexual harassment is a much broader term than sexual assault, and refers to a wider variety of inappropriate sexual behaviours. Sexual harassment can include sexual contact - like unwanted touching, hugging, or kissing.
                            Sexual assault is when you are forced, coerced or tricked into doing some sort of sexual activity, including touching, kissing, sexual acts, or penetrative sex. Some cases of sexual harassment can also constitute sexual assault. For example, if your boss or colleague forced you to kiss them, or touched you inappropriately without your consent, that could be a case of both sexual harassment and sexual assault.

                            •	feel stressed, anxious or depressed
                            •	withdraw from social situations

                            •	have physical symptoms of stress, such as headaches, backaches or sleep problems
